    """
    Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.

    Since the result could be very large, you should return the largest palindrome mod 1337.

    Example:

    Input: 2

    Output: 987

    Explanation: 99 x 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987

    Note:

    The range of n is [1,8].
